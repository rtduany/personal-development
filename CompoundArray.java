/*
You have to create a method "compoundArray" which should take as input two int arrays of different length and return one int array with numbers of both arrays shuffled one by one. Example: Input - {1,2,3,4,5,6} and {9,8,7,6} Output - {1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5,6}
*/
/*
Declare the c array with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of the two arrays. Then use System.arraycopy to copy the contents of the original arrays into the new array, being careful to copy them into the destination array at the correct start index. I would use an arraylist since the size is not permanent.
