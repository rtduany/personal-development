/* In this kata, you must create a digital root function. A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has two digits, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers. Here's how it works (Ruby example given):
digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7
